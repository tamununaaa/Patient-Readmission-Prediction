# üè• Patient Readmission Prediction  
This project predicts hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients using machine learning models. It analyzes patient data to identify key factors influencing readmission and builds a predictive model for early intervention.  

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the **Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset**, which contains patient records with features such as:  

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, race  
- **Medical history:** Prior diagnoses, medications, lab results  
- **Hospital visit details:** Length of stay, admission type, discharge disposition  
- **Medications:** Insulin and other diabetes-related drugs  


### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize numerical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Feature distribution analysis  
   - Correlation between variables  
   - Identifying outliers  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - Train multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
  
 
   - Hyperparameter tuning  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC
